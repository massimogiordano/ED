        h2 Introduction to  heterostructures
        p
         | Optoelectronics, RF electronics and high-power and high-frequency electronics demand semiconductor alloys. These applications need materials pcharacterstics to be thoroughly tailored and such requirement is fulfilled through the engineering of optical, transport and electrical properties. 
         |The most common alloys are based on different semiconductive compounds (e.g. GaN, GaAs and InP) and they can be ternary or quaternary such as Al_xGa_{1-x}As and In_xGa_{1-x}As_yP_{1-y}.
         | An heterostructure is a physical system made of materials with different bandgap but with resembling structural properties i.e. crystal lattice and lattice parameter.
         |Heteroepitaxy is the method underlying the modern growth technologies to build these systems. The most exploited techniques are MOCVD and MBE and they may harness buffer layers (i.e. alloys with gradually changing composition) to smooth the transition from one material to another to reduce strain and avoid defects.
         | III-nitrides have gained remarkable importance since they overcame the limitations of  GaAs based electronic devices for high-temperature applications and enabled to design and to fabricate optoelectronic devices in the blue and violet spectrum range. Moreover, devices working at short wavelength are required in a broad technology range, e.g. laser printers, under water communications and high density information storage. The III-nitrides bandgaps are large and direct. In details, they vary from  0.7eV (InN), 3.4 eV (GaN) and 6.2 eV (AlN)  for wurtzite semiconductors. 
         | Because of the wide energy gap and significant bond strength they can be exploited to produce short wavelength LED and high-temperature transistors. [tesi]
         |In particular, AlGaN/GaN based High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) play a crucial role in next generation 3G/4G mobile phone stations, radar, mixers and oscillators. [lenka, chractersitics study]
         | GaN-based materials provide high frequency operation (tens of GHz), high saturation velocity ($\sim 10^7 cm/s$), large breakdown electric field ($3 MV/cm$) and high power density of an AlGaN/GaN HEMT over 11W/mm. Most importantly, polarization fields allow a larger two dimensional electron gas (extensively discussed in the following chapter) to be confined than in AlGaAs/GaAs HEMT. For all these reason GaN-based HEMTs have a key role in developing advanced electronic devices.  Despite all these highly promising features, there is still challenging work to carry out in order to gain a deep comprehension and control of band structure and quantum confinement in III-nitrides based transistors. In fact, polarization charges at the heterointerface and electronic properties are to be understood to achieve optical and electronic application in novel devices.

        h2 Equilibrium condition and two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) 
        p
        | Heterojunction is formed whenever two materials with different bandgaps are brought to contact. To realize thermodynamic equilibrium the fermi level has to be constant thoughout the whole system so there is charge flow until the mentioned condition is achieved. Electrons diffuse from higher Fermi energy material to the lower Fermi energy one and holes diffuse toward opposite direction. Carriers flow leads to not neutral region close to the heterointerface hence generating an electric field that causes the bands to bend. This built-in electrostatic field generates a drift current that counterbalance the diffusion and these counteracting effects make the system evolve to equilibrium.
        | The below image is devoted to illustrate the band diagram evolution.
        //include img/bandDiagr
        //| The built-in potential is determined by the driving force of this mechanism i.e. the Fermi levels difference:
        //.equation.svg#Vbi
        //| qV_{bi} = E_{f,2} - E_{f,1}
        | All quantities can be expressed through bulk semiconductor model formulas and the interface can be treated with the formalism develeped for homojunctions.
        | The Anderson's rule, also known as affinity rule, states that the band bending is dictated by electron affinities and this implies that the conduction and valence band discontinuities are respectively given by:
        .equation.svg#affinityrule
         | \Delta E_c = \text{q}(\chi_2 - \chi_1) \text{and} \Delta E_v = \Delta E_g + \text{-q}(\chi_2 - \chi_1)
        | Let us consider a n-doped (material 2) and a p-doped (material 1) semiconductors forming an heterojunction as example. This may be the case for AlGaN/GaN interface with Si donors in AlGaN and Mg acceptors in GaN.

        h2 Triangular well
        p
        |  The triangular quantum well is the most suitable model to describe the 2DEG according to semiclassical approximation. To analyze let us consider a 1-dimensional problem with an uniform and constant electrical field along x-direction $\vec \varepsilon  = \varepsilon \hat{x}$ . The electrostatic potential to be added in the time-indipendent single-particle Schroedinger equation in order to implement the interaction of an electron with this electric field is $\phi (x) = q \varepsilon x $. It follows that the Schroedinger equation to be solved is:
        //.equation.svg#eqSCHROD
        //equazione
        |Defining the 'characteristic' length and energy 
        .equation.svg

        |and a new adimensional variable $s = x/x_0 - E/E_0$ eq
        //citare .equation.svg#eqSCHROD

        //.equation.svg#eqSCHROD-AIRY
        //equazione
        | This differential equation has known solutions, i.e. the Airy functions. To satisfy physical requirements only one Airy function is acceptable, namely 
        .equation.svg
         |A_i(x)= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{+\infty} \text{cos}\left( xt + \frac{t^3}{3}  \right)\,dt
        //.equation.svg#z_zero e E_zero
        //eqni.
        | Eigenvalues are calculated by applying the boundary condition according to which the wavefunction is null at $x=0$. Stationary states energies are determined by the zeros of the Airy functions and are directly proportional to the characteristic energy $E_0$ thus depend on the effective mass of the electron and the electric field. Below, the expression for the general eigenvalue $E_j$ is given.
        .equation.svg#TriangEigenV
         | E_j = c_j E_0 = c_j \left( \frac{(q \varepsilon \hbar)^2 }{2 m^*}\right)^{1/3}
        where $c_j$ is the $j^{th}$ zero of the Airy function.
        |For the purpose of this report it should be highlighted that in case of a 2DEG at the heterointerface of a wide bandgap semiconductor and a narrow bandgap one the built-it electric field causes the quantum confinement. In details, it is strictly related to the electron surface density. Such concentration is specifically the sheet carrier charge density characterizing the 2DEG in the triangular well. Using a capacitor-like model, the built-in electric field is found to be linearly proportional to $n_s$. Hence it is valid to rewrite:

         | E_j = \gamma_j (n_s)^{2/3}

        p
         | In order to rapidly and accurately simulate HEMT devices an analytical expression for density of the two dimensional gas $n_s$ is required.
         |So far $n_s$ has been usually expressed with numerical calculations, which require high computational power due to their iterative methods, or through empirical models, which use large number of empirical parameters obtained by experimental data. 
         |At the beginning of the 80s the interdependence between $n_s$ and $E_f$ was at first assumed constant

         |, however those models are not able to properly predict the results while changing the operating conditions at which they were studied. In particular Cutoff Voltage and Temperature dependences have shown to be critical.<br>  
         |In this report a physical-based analytical model for the relation of $E_f$ and $n_s$ is presented following the work done by S. Khandelwal, N. Goyal and T. Fjeldly

         |The reason why only the first two sub-bands are taken into account relies not on the number of bounded states present in the quantum well but on their probability of occupation. To give an estimate of those values we  have assumed that the quantum-well is triangular and the energies bounded states can not be higher than the built in potential.

            h2 Unified model and explicit formula for 2DEG charge density
            p

            | A unified analytical expression for the sheet carrier charge density versus the gate voltage is sought. To achieve this goal a physically reasonable merging of the distinct behaviors in region I and II is needed. The $n_s$ expressions in the two zones differ in two terms both dependending on the thermal voltage $V_{th}$ (one term in the numerator and the other one in the denominator). Therefore, it is to be expected that both the regional models provide an acceptable description for the whole gate voltage range expect very close to the cutoff value. The following graphs aim at illustrating and analysing the accuracy of each of the regional models and a first unified model for $n_s$ and $E_f$, which does not considering the thermal voltage, when applied to the full voltage range.
            //mettere plot
            |Since the analytical description provided  by this first unified model is in fairly agreement with the regional ones it may seem satisfying, nonetheless the accuracy can be improved.
            |In fact,the two regional models can be combined using proper interpolation expressions that  are shown below.
            .equation.svg#InterpolExpress
             |V_{gon}= \frac{V_{go} \text{e}}{\beta \sqrt{V_{go}^2 + (\text{e}/ \beta)^2}} \ , \  V_{god}= \frac{V_{go} }{\beta \sqrt{V_{go}^2 + (\text{e}/ \beta)^2}}.
             
            |The final computed unified $n_s = n_s(V_{go})$ equals:

            | This proposed model takes into account the temperature dependence and it adjusts and balances the behavior of $n_s^I$ and $n_s^{II}$, in fact if they were used to describe the sheet carrier charge density throughout the whole voltage range they would respectively overestimante and underestimate this physical quantity. This consideration is justified by an inspection of the following graph which represents the difference from the numerical solution $n_s^N$ of $n_s^I$ and $n_s^{II}$.

             |The unified model has the highest precision as the below graph illustrates. It shows the absolute error with respect the numerical data set. The accuracy diminishes as the voltage reaches the cutoff value, in fact this is a critical region for every developed model even though the unified one remains the best performing. The steep rise of the error is due to the validity loss of the linear approximation for the Taylor series expansion with respect to $E_f^I/V_{go}$ within a close range of the cutoff value.
             | It can be also highlighted that $n_s^I$ provides an acceptable analytical model for Region II having a relative error always equal or smaller than $2.5 \%$ whereas this can not be stated for $n_s^{II}$ in region I.

             | It is physically meaningful to investigate the precision of the present model at elevated temperatures since GaN-based HEMT are particularly interesting for high-power applications. The below plot represents the sheet carrier charge density versus the gate voltage computed at different temperatures: 200K, 300K, 400K and 500K.   The temperature rise leads to an increase of the error near the cutoff region. Despite this, the unified model does not remarkably deviates from numerical solution of the analytical expression hence producing accpetable results.
