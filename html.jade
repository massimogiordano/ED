         // | The report aim is to simulate by means of MATLAB the theoretical work done on AlGaN/GaN HEMT devices by Sourabh Khandelwal, Nitin Goyal, and Tor A. Fjeldly in their published article $\textit{A Physics-Based Analytical Model for 2DEG Charge Density in AlGaN/GaN HEMT Devices}$, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 58, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2011. As the scientific paper is presented along with its most important results all the critical steps are considered and analysed in order to clarify and justify the steps that have contributed to build up this approximated yet promising analytical model.
          | To enable a solid comprehension of all the physics concepts that will be mentioned and studied we provide a concise introductory part about heterostructures, simple quantum-mechanical observations and high electron mobility transistors.

        h2 Introduction to  heterostructures
        p
         |High-power and high-frequency applications, as well as optoelectronics, RF electronics, demand materials the which characteristics can be thoroughly tailored. Since alloys can widely change their optical, transport and electrical properties upon their concentration, are the most used material for those applications.  
         |In general alloys are based on different semiconductive compounds (e.g. GaN, GaAs and InP). Depending on the number of elements they are made of they can be ternary or quaternary such as $Al_xGa_{1-x}As$ and $In_xGa_{1-x}As_yP_{1-y}$.
         |<br> An heterostructure is a physical system made of materials with different bandgap but with resembling structural properties i.e. crystal lattice and lattice parameter.
         |Heteroepitaxy is the method underlying the modern growth technologies to build these systems, usually by MOCVD or MBE. They may harness buffer layers (i.e. alloys with gradually changing composition) to smooth the transition from one material to another to reduce strain and avoid defects.<br>
         |The III-nitrides bandgaps are large and direct, in detail, considering Wurtzite structure, they can vary from  0.7eV (InN), 3.4 eV (GaN) up to 6.2 eV (AlN). 
         | Because of the wide energy gap and significant bond strength III-nitrides have gained remarkable importance, mainly because they overcame the limitations of GaAs based electronic devices, enabling the design and fabrication of optoelectronic devices at short wavelength such as LED, laser printers, under water communications, high density information storage and high-temperature transistors. 
         cit#tesi
         |<br>In particular, AlGaN/GaN based High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) play a crucial role in next generation 3G/4G mobile phone stations, radar, mixers and oscillators. 
         cit#lenka
         |<br>GaN-based materials provide high frequency operation (tens of GHz), high saturation velocity ($\sim 10^7 cm/s$), large breakdown electric field ($3 MV/cm$) and high power density of an AlGaN/GaN HEMT over $11W/mm$. Even more important are polarization fields which allow the formation of larger two dimensional electron gas (see chapter ##) compared to AlGaAs/GaAs based HEMT. 
         |<br>For all these reasons GaN-based HEMTs have a key role in the developing of advanced electronic devices. However, despite all the highly promising features, there is still lot of challenging work to carry out in order to gain a deep understanding of their behavior. In fact, in order to fabricate novel devices based on III-nitrides, good description of band structure, quantum confinement polarization charges and the electron mobility have to be obtained. 
         
       section
        h2 Heterojunction equilibrium 
        p
        | Heterojunction is formed whenever two materials with different bandgaps are brought to contact. Electrons start to diffuse from higher Fermi energy material to the lower one while holes diffuse toward the opposite direction. The carriers flow leads to an accumulation of electrons and hole at the interface which generates an electric field, which generates a drift force on the carries counterbalancing the diffusion process. The two effects, diffusion and drift, are balanced at the thermodynamic equilibrium that is obtained when Fermi Level results constant over the whole system. 
        |<br>The presence of the electric field at the interface generates the so-called built-in potential, which causes the  bands structure to bend.
        | Below, the image shows the band diagram structure and its evolution at the interface. 
        //include img/bandDiagr
        | The conduction and valence band discontinuities are determinate by the electron affinities $\chi_i$ of the two semiconductors using the Anderson's rule, also known as affinity rule, which reads:
        .equation.svg#affinityrule 
         | \Delta E_c = \text{q}(\chi_2 - \chi_1)\quad \text{and}\quad \Delta E_v = \Delta E_g - \text{q}(\chi_2 - \chi_1)
        |Therefor, the built in potential at a heterojuction made of two intrinsic semiconductors becomes: 
        .equation.svg
         | V_{\text{bi}} = \Delta \chi + \frac{\Delta E_g}{2q}
        | Let us consider a n-doped (material 2) and a p-doped (material 1) semiconductors forming an heterojunction as example. This may be the case for AlGaN/GaN interface with Si donors in AlGaN and Mg acceptors in GaN.
        | At equilibrium bands are bent and the interface discontinuity is conserved whereas the vacuum energy level is continous throught the whole system and it is not constant. The relative band alignment is achieved by the creation of built-in electric field whose related electrostatic potential is:
        .equation.svg#Vbi
         | qV_{bi} = E_{f,2} - E_{f,1} 
        | Expliciting the Fermi energies as function of dopants concentration the previous expression can be cast as follows:
        .equation.svg#Vbi2
         | qV_{bi} = E_{g,1} - \Delta E_c + \text{ln}\left(\frac{N_a N_d}{N_{c,2}N_{v,1}}\right)
        | $N_a$ and $N_d$ indicate  the dopant concentration of the two materials while $N_{c,2}$ and $N_{v,1}$ indicate the effective density of states in the conduction and the valence band of the specified semiconductors.
        | It is to be stressed the fact that heterostructures are non homogenous media thus the key physical quantity to be examined at the interface is the electrical displacement field $\vec D$. Gauss's law is rewritten in its most general form:
        .equation.svg#electricdisplacement
         | \vec {\triangledown} \cdot  {\bf D} = \rho \quad \text{with} \quad \, {\bf D} = \epsilon_0 \vec{\bf \varepsilon }+ {\bf P}
        | It is worthwile noticing that unlike homojunction junction law applied to heterojunctions yields that minority carrier injection is enhanced toward smaller bandgap material. It is due to the ratio of minority carrier concentration at each boundary of deleption regions which depends on doping level but also on energy bandgap and the dependence from the latter is exponential.
        | Band discontinuity may be so high at the interface that a potential well may form and create carrier and/or optical confinement. The quantum well originates from $E_c$ bending enough to become lower than the Fermi level for a close range near the junction in the smaller bandgap material. Electrons are trapped at the interface on the p-side (typical confinement length $1 \div 10 nm)$. Carrier trapping is 1D therefore on the interface parallel surface electrons can be considered freely traveling since dopant acting as scattering center are reduced very close to the interface. Consequently quantization effects affect band structure and density of states (DOS or g).

        h2 Two dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
        p
        | It is the sheet carrier charge concentration ($n_s$) forced by the built-in electric field to the heterointerface. Subbands are created due to quantum confinement.       
        | Schroedinger's equation and Poisson equation are to be solved self-consistently if the real physical solution is sought. Furthermore, the total potential $V_{tot}$ should account for the electrostatic electron-electron repulsion, exchange-correlation effect and barrier potential. The interface charge concentration $n_s$ influences $V_{tot}$ and at the same time $n_s$ is by the sum of each subband contribution weighted by the probability to find electrons in that state, i.e. the square modulus of the wavefunction. Therefore what it follows, it is a simple, semiclassical yet efficient explanation of the physics underlying this system.
        | Stationary energy levels are determined by the almost free motion parallel (yz plane) to the junction plus the confinement normal (x direction) to it.
        .equation.svg#e_values
         | E_{j,\vec k_{//}} = E_j + \frac{\hbar^2 k_{//}}{2m*}
        | Let us consider the 2DEG within a large potential well in yz plane with infinite barriers such that wavefunctions are null at boundaries. The density of states taking into account all subbands contributions is:
        .equation.svg#g2D
         | g_{2D}(E)=  \sum_{j=1}^{+\infty} \left[ \frac{4 \pi m^*}{\hbar ^2}H(E-E_j) \right]
        |The DOS is then used to calculate the sheet carrier charge density of the 2DEG:
        .equation.svg#ns2D
         | n_s = \int_{E_c}^{+\infty} g_{2D}(E)f_{FD}(E) \, dE = \frac{4 \pi m^* K_B T}{h^2}\sum_j ln \left[ 1+\frac{E_f - E_j}{K_B T}\right]
        
        
       section
        h2 Quantum triangular well
        p
        |  The triangular quantum well is the most suitable model to describe the 2DEG according to semi classical approximation. To analyze let us consider a 1-dimensional problem with an uniform and constant electrical field along x-direction $\vec \varepsilon  = \varepsilon \hat{x}$ . The electrostatic potential to be added in the time-independent single-particle Schroedinger equation in order to implement the interaction of an electron with this electric field is $\phi (x) = q \varepsilon x $. It follows that the Schroedinger equation to be solved is:
        //.equation.svg#eqSCHROD
        //equazione
        |Defining the 'characteristic' length and energy 
        .equation.svg
         |x_0 = \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m^* q \varepsilon }\right)^{1/3} \text{and} \ \ \ E_0 =\left(   \frac{ (q \varepsilon \hbar)^2 }{2 m^*} \right)^{1/3} 
        |and a new adimensional variable $s = \frac{x}{x_0} - \frac{E}{E_0}$ eq
        //citare .equation.svg#eqSCHROD
        |can be cast in the below expression
        //.equation.svg#eqSCHROD-AIRY
        //equazione
        | This differential equation has known solutions, i.e. the Airy functions. To satisfy physical requirements only one Airy function is acceptable, namely 
        .equation.svg
         |A_i(x)= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{+\infty} \text{cos}\left( xt + \frac{t^3}{3}  \right)\,dt
        //.equation.svg#z_zero e E_zero
        //eqni.
        | Eigenvalues are calculated by applying the boundary condition according to which the wavefunction is null at $x=0$. Stationary states energies are determined by the zeros of the Airy functions and are directly proportional to the characteristic energy $E_0$ thus depend on the effective mass of the electron and the electric field. Below, the expression for the general eigenvalue $E_j$ is given.
        .equation.svg#TriangEigenV
         | E_j = c_j E_0 = c_j \left( \frac{(q \varepsilon \hbar)^2 }{2 m^*}\right)^{1/3}
        |where $c_j$ is the $j^{th}$ zero of the Airy function.
        |For the purpose of this report it should be highlighted that in case of a 2DEG at the heterointerface of a wide bandgap semiconductor and a narrow bandgap one the built-it electric field causes the quantum confinement. In details, it is strictly related to the electron surface density. Such concentration is specifically the sheet carrier charge density characterizing the 2DEG in the triangular well. Using a capacitor-like model, the built-in electric field is found to be linearly proportional to $n_s$. Hence it is valid to rewrite:
        .equation.svg#Subbands-NS23
         | E_j = \gamma_j (n_s)^{2/3}
        

        | This step is reasonable, in fact even though the relationship of $E_j$ with $n_s$ is physically acceptable, the triangular well is a simplistic approximation therefore the proportionality constants are experimentally determined.

        h2 Wurtzite semiconductors in heterostructures

        p
        |  Polarization induced sheet charge density is here discussed. The focus will be on III-N semiconductors having wurtzite crystal lattice. This 3D atomic arrangement is noncentrosymmetric hence it originates a pyroelectric compound system, i.e. with spontaneous polairzation. Such material is consequently piezoelectric. Therefore the total polarization is given by these two properties in wurtzite lattices.
        | At heterointerfaces the polarization gradient leads to bound interface charges according to the general Gauss's law eq
        eq#electricdisplacement
        | AlN, InN and GaN have high spontaneous polarizations (up to $0.09C/m^{-2}$ as in AlN) meanwhile the spontaneous polarization change rate with temperature is small (e.g 7.5 \mu C / (Km^{-2}) for AlN) at room temperature. This is extremely useful for high power and high temperature applications, e.g. microwave amplifier, lasers and surface acoustic wave devices (SAWs). As to what regards the piezoelectric constants it has been reported that they are greater by a factor ranging from 5 to 20 than those of III-arsenides semiconductors (J. Appl. Phys. 86, 1 (1999); doi: 10.1063/1.371145). Spontanoues and piezoelectric polarization gradients cause strong electric field at heterojunctions (Applied Physics Letters 74, 2361 (1999); doi: 10.1063/1.123851) and this has significant impact on charge distribution and lifetime of carrier within the 2DEG.
        | Polarization plays a fundamental role in pseudomorphic wurtzite AlGaN/GaN based transistors according to scientific literature ($\textit{Undoped AlGaN/GaN HEMTs for Microwave Power Amplification}$, Lester F. Eastman, et al.,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 48, NO. 3, MARCH 2001).
        | The most common growth direction on GaN substrate is normal to the basal plane {0001} where atoms are arranged in bilayers. These bilayers consist of closely spaced hexagonal sheets, one formed by cations and the other by anions thus leading to polar faces. Therefore  in GaN-based heterostructure the basal face is either Ga or N and this leads repsectively to $0001$ or $000 \bar 1 $ polarity. The key point is to notice that different polarity determines different physical and chemical characteristics. Ga-faced GaN means that Ga atoms occupy top positions of the {0001} bilayer (in case of N-faced it is analogous). 
        | Surface defects and surface contamination can screen bound surface charge due to polarization discotinuity across an interface. Such sheet charge accumulation can lead to two dimensional electron gas formation because it can occur that a surface electron density builds up in order to compensate the excess of positive polarization induced charge.
        | It should be clear at this point that 2DEG in AlGaN/GaN devices is influenced by internal as well as external properties. This opens new ways to modulate carrier concentration of the 2DEG with respect to GaAs-based devices. Sensors exploiting polarization induced 2DEG can be built and these can rely on three main working principle: surface charge manipulation (interaction with ions and molecules), mechanical stress application (pressure) and direct carriers manipulation (external electric field).

         | This chapter will firstly briefly introduce HEMTs and it will secondly discuss  a simple physics-based electrical model for HEMTs.
         | 2DEG leads to outstanding transport properties in particular its high electrical mobility can reach $\sim 10^3 cm{2}/(V s)$ at room temperature ($\textit{Analysis of thin AlN carrier exclusion layers in AlGaN/GaN microwave heterojunction field-effect transistors}$, R S Balmer et al.,Semicond. Sci. Technol. 19 (2004) L65–L67). In addition, GaN has excellent electrical and thermal characteristics, to be more specific it is also electrically stable and it is a superior heat conductor. GaN-based devices offer advantages such as high breakdown field (critical breakdown field $\sim 3 \div 5 MV/cm$), high charge density and  very high electron mobility [t7.3]–[t7.5]. 
         | In HEMT the channel carrier density $n_s$ is given by eq
         eq#ns2D
         | according to the simplified model. Since $n_s$ and the confinement electric field are related the gate voltage can be used to vary the interface electric field hence controlling the number of carrier in the 2DEG.

        h1 Charge density Analytical Model
        p
         | In order to rapidly and accurately simulate HEMT devices an analytical expression for density of the two dimensional gas $n_s$ is required.
         |So far $n_s$ has been usually expressed with numerical calculations, which require high computational power due to their iterative methods, or through empirical models, which use large number of empirical parameters obtained by experimental data. 
         |At the beginning of the 80s the interdependence between $n_s$ and $E_f$ was at first assumed constant 
         cit#firstmodel
         |, then linear and quadratic
         cit#secondmodel
         |, however those models are not able to properly predict the results while changing the operating conditions at which they were studied. In particular Cutoff Voltage and Temperature dependences have shown to be critical.<br>  
         |In this report a physical-based analytical model for the relation of $E_f$ and $n_s$ is presented following the work done by S. Khandelwal, N. Goyal and T. Fjeldly 
         cit#main

        h2 Contribution of sub-bands to $n_s$

         |The reason why only the first two sub-bands are taken into account relies not on the number of bounded states present in the quantum well but on their probability of occupation.

             |Since $E_f$ is much smaller than $V_{\text{go}}$ we can expand the Taylor Series to the first order in $E_f^I/V_{\text{go}}$ . Despite the fact that for voltages very close to cutoff $E_f^I$ is not significantly smaller than $V_{\text{go}}$ the ultimate results provided by this work are in agreement with the numerical solution. This point is extensively discussed in chapter #7cicciarculo7#.

            h2 Unified model and explicit formula for 2DEG charge density
            p

            | A unified analytical expression for the sheet carrier charge density versus the gate voltage is sought. To achieve this goal a physically reasonable merging of the distinct behaviors in region I and II is needed. The $n_s$ expressions in the two zones differ in two terms both dependending on the thermal voltage $V_{th}$ (one term in the numerator and the other one in the denominator). Therefore, it is to be expected that both the regional models provide an acceptable description for the whole gate voltage range expect very close to the cutoff value. The following graphs aim at illustrating and analysing the accuracy of each of the regional models and a first unified model for $n_s$ and $E_f$, which does not considering the thermal voltage, when applied to the full voltage range.
            //mettere plot
            |Since the analytical description provided  by this first unified model is in fairly agreement with the regional ones it may seem satisfying, nonetheless the accuracy can be improved.
            |In fact,the two regional models can be combined using proper interpolation expressions that  are shown below.
            .equation.svg#InterpolExpress
             |V_{gon}= \frac{V_{go} \text{e}}{\beta \sqrt{V_{go}^2 + (\text{e}/ \beta)^2}} \ , \  V_{god}= \frac{V_{go} }{\beta \sqrt{V_{go}^2 + (\text{e}/ \beta)^2}}.
             
            |The final computed unified $n_s = n_s(V_{go})$ equals:
            //.equation.svg#NSunified
            //formula ns unificato
            
            | This proposed model takes into account the temperature dependence and it adjusts and balances the behavior of $n_s^I$ and $n_s^{II}$, in fact if they were used to describe the sheet carrier charge density throughout the whole voltage range they would respectively overestimante and underestimate this physical quantity. This consideration is justified by an inspection of the following graph which represents the difference from the numerical solution $n_s^N$ of $n_s^I$ and $n_s^{II}$.

             | The developed model is compared with the two regional models at room temperature. It is to be noticed that all models are in good agreement with the numerical solution. 
             //plot
             |The unified model has the highest precision as the below graph illustrates. It shows the absolute error with respect the numerical data set. The accuracy diminishes as the voltage reaches the cutoff value, in fact this is a critical region for every developed model even though the unified one remains the best performing. The steep rise of the error is due to the validity loss of the linear approximation for the Taylor series expansion with respect to $E_f^I/V_{go}$ within a close range of the cutoff value.
             | It can be also highlighted that $n_s^I$ provides an acceptable analytical model for Region II having a relative error always equal or smaller than $2.5 \%$ whereas this can not be stated for $n_s^{II}$ in region I.

             h2 Temperature dependence
             p
             | It is physically meaningful to investigate the precision of the present model at elevated temperatures since GaN-based HEMT are particularly interesting for high-power applications. The below plot represents the sheet carrier charge density versus the gate voltage computed at different temperatures: 200K, 300K, 400K and 500K.   The temperature rise leads to an increase of the error near the cutoff region. Despite this, the unified model does not remarkably deviates from numerical solution of the analytical expression hence producing accpetable results.
