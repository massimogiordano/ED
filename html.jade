        h1 Charge density Analytical Model
        p
         | In order to rapidly and accurately simulate HEMT devices an analytical expression for density of the two dimensional gas $n_s$ is required.
         |So far $n_s$ has been usually expressed with numerical calculations, which require high computational power due to their iterative methods, or through empirical models, which use large number of empirical parameters obtained by experimental data. 
         |At the beginning of the 80s the interdependence between $n_s$ and $E_f$ was at first assumed constant 
         cit#firstmodel
         |, then linear and quadratic
         cit#secondmodel
         |, however those models are not able to properly predict the results while changing the operating conditions at which they were studied. In particular Cutoff Voltage and Temperature dependences have shown to be critical.<br>  
         |In this report a physical-based analytical model for the relation of $E_f$ and $n_s$ is presented following the work done by S. Khandelwal, N. Goyal and T. Fjeldly 
         cit#main
         |, which takes into account the first two energy sub-bands present in the quantum well and their contribution to the $n_s$ variation.
         
         
      section
        h2 Discussion of the contribution of sub-bands to $n_s$
        p
         |The reason why only the first two sub-bands are taken into account relies not on the number of bounded states present in the quantum well but on their probability of occupation. To give an estimate of those values we  have assumed that the quantum-well is triangular and the energies bounded states can not be higher than the built in potential.

        h2 Fermi energy and Sub-bands with respect to Gate Voltage
        p
         |In order to obtain $n_s$ we solved numerically the two equations system of eq 1-2, as estensely described in chapeter ##2DEG. 
         //codice matlab
         |This is needed to find $E_f$, $E_0$ and $E_1$ using the eq. (citE=n^2/3). Below the plot show the relation between $E_f$ and the two sub-bands with respect to the gate voltage and the temperature. 
         //plot with bar
         |As we can see in the plot $E_f$ intersect only $E_0$ and this point is important because allow to distingusce two regions. To further highlith this behavior we plot the difference between $E_f$ and the two energy sub-bands $E_0$ and $E_1$. 
         //plot
         |$E_1$ is always larger than $E_f$ and $E_0$ while $E_0$ in smaller then $E_f$ in region 1 while in the second region $E_0$ is always greater then $E_f$. The width of the first region increase with the temperature. (WHY?!?)  
         |A different model is developed for each regions, then they will be unify to obtain a continuous solution. 
          
         
         
         
         
         //|In the quantum well a high number of bounded states are available, however only the first two are taken into account because of the probability of occupation. We estimated those values assuming a triangular well with maximum potential equal to the built in obtained through the work functions.
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         //| The reason why only the first two energy sub-bands are considered can be explained by the probability of their occupation. In fact, as the following plot show, the number of bound states present in the quantum well is much higher. Considering a triangular well

            h2 Region I and approximations
            p 
             |In region I the second term of eq. (1cit) is negligible and the first logarithm term can be approximated to the exponential component of its argument. Therefor eq. ##1 can be rewritten as
             .equation.svg#nsIaprox
              |n_s = DV_{th} \ \text{exp}\left(  \frac{E_f -E_0}{V_{th}} \right) 
             |Therefor, $E_f$ can be expressed in region I as
             .equation.svg#efin1
              |E_f^{I} \approx \gamma_0 (n_s^I)^{\frac{2}{3}} + V_{\text{th}} \text{ln} \left( \frac{n_s^I}{D V_{\text{th}}}\right)
             |In the following plot we can see how the approximation fit well the Fermi Energy in the first region, the maximum absolute error is about ## and lies on the separation line between the two regions. 
             |In order to find out how the gate bias determinate explicitly $E_f$ and  $n_s$ we have to delete the interdependence of $E_f$ and $n_s$ in eq
             eq#efin1
             |. To do so we replace $n_s$ in eq 
             eq#efin1
             |with the following expression
             .equation.svg
              |n_s = \frac{\epsilon}{qd}\left(V_{\text{go}} - E_f \right)
             |Since $E_f$ is much smaller than $V_{\text{go}}$ we can expand the Taylor Series to the first order in $E_f^I/V_{\text{go}}$ . Despite the fact that for voltages very close to cutoff $E_f^I$ is not significantly smaller than $V_{\text{go}}$ the ultimate results provided by this work are in agreement with the numerical solution. This point is extensively discussed in chapter #7cicciarculo7#.
